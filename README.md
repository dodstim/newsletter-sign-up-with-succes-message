### Difficulty
E-mail validation was my biggest difficulty, it took me two days trying to validate it using different methods and finally I reached the conclusion of the challenge at 6:45 pm, using regex for validation. Although I understood the logical steps, something wasn't working correctly when it came to the attempts to validate by going through an array of special characters and checking if the email sent contained those characters. So I did an intensive search in key points until I reached regex, where I could understand its structure to validate an email and thus use it in the project.
